#### From the Top of the list according to your instrucctions: ####

I have worked with git before and [as you can see by my repo](https://github.com/acedesigns/), though it hasn't been kept up to date.

#### jekyll
[I have had a GitHub Page](https://github.com/acedesigns/acedesigns.github.io) for over 6 Months now, but I cannot remember the tutorial I followed to get it up and running. however I kow that, [The official Website was one](https://pages.github.com/) as well as the [Jekyll Official Website](http://jekyllrb.com/)


### Gulp Task Runners
I have code snippets of Gulp, Grunt, Tasks that I have created in the past over at GitHub Gist :

1. [Gulp Task Runner](https://gist.github.com/acedesigns/9388eacc7a26097c9654) but for a more [simplified one](https://github.com/acedesigns/Setup-Work-Flow/blob/master/angular/gulpfile.js)
2. [Grunt Task Runner](https://gist.github.com/acedesigns/bdba1c234817b97f2552). This one is a run down of the Yoman starter template as indicated by the description, Just run the following command `npm install && grunt serve`


### Flexbox
Flexbox wasrelatively new to me even though I heard about it but never actually got to play with it. So [CSS FlexBox Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7EIAgfkhmg) was really a `Get up an running` with it quickly.

### Responsive Site
In my `style.scss` file I have included two media queries on top of what bootstrap provides, becouse I caould not test on screens who's screens are 320px and 480px wide.

Also there is a css only progress lib I included for showing how far I am with each Goal `[circle.css](http://circle.firchow.net/)`.


### Conclusion
I think Flexbox was the highlight of this test and it's really an awsome trick insted of writing all that CSS. 
The test was not too hard, I just got frustrated in the beggining of things, was taking long to get into the rhythim of things and perhaps because I am on an [Ubuntu Machine 14.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and I do not have Illustrator nor Do I know how to slice from it. I only know Photoshop.

Also Please kindly excuse me for not using the icons as you requeste due to the reason stated above.

Oh, I only did this test on `Saturday 27-Feb-2015` so tacknically I did it in one day. Where I was paying full attension to it.

Apologies if my Documentatin is not clear enough to your liking. :sweat: :calling:
